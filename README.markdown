PHP NBT Decoder / Encoder
=========================

A PHP-based NBT format decoder and encoder, for the Minecraft NBT format.  
A basic usage example is available in test.php. I suggest you run this script
before you use the library for any other project, because this script acts
as a sort of "requirements test" for your system, to ensure you have the
right extensions, and that there's nothing funky with your configuration.

**Requires the GMP Extension for PHP.**
